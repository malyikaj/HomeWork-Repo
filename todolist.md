1. Users should be able to see five buttons for the five boroughs (manhattan, brooklyn, queens, staten island, bronx) of New York City when they load the page
2. Users should also be able to see an input box where they can put in a number of how many complaints they want to see

3. When the user clicks on one of the five buttons, a list of complaints should be displayed on the page, according to the number they input AND the borough they clicked on
4. If the user doesn't input any number, make the default be 10
5. Remember, also, they only want complaints that were handled by the NYPD! (hint: consider filtering for a specific "agency" when making the API call)
6. When the list of complaints is shown, each complaint should also have a button on it that reads something along the lines of "toggle police response"
7. When the user clicks on on the "toggle police response" button, it should then toggle how the police responded to that particular complaint
8. Make sure it only toggles the response for that one complaint, not the entire list!
